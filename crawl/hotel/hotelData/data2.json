We were traveling with 2 moms and 2 daughters and we did the bunk room. It was small but perfect for our needs — and we all got our own bed. The beds were incredibly comfortable and the hotel was so clean. We were a short walk from the subway for trips to Time Square and Broadway and had great food options nearby. Highly recommend!", "reviewer_stay_date": "Date of stay: May 2023", "reviewer_trip_type": "family"},
